# My attempt at the CryptoPals Challenges in C++

Made 2 different attempts with the first attempt consisting of a solo venture into the first 5 challenges.
Poorly written and revised later into V2.

The second attempt consisted of the first 11 challenges. The first 5 were revised and completed independently. Challenges 6-11 were completed with a partner.

Might try a third attempt in C++ to make the code more efficient.
